# AIS/AIMS Data Visualization Final Project

## Exploring the Intersection of Happiness, Health, and Wealth: A Global Perspective"

*In this project, we investigate the relationship between three key indicators of societal success: **happiness**, **health**, and **wealth**. By analyzing data from countries around the world, we aim to gain a better understanding of how these factors intersect and influence one another. Through our exploration of this complex topic, we hope to shed light on what it truly means for a society to be 'successful' and what factors contribute to this success.*
